Write an simple app that displays the user’s contacts in a table view. Each cell should display first name, last name, and image. Tapping a contact should push a view controller that shows the contact’s home address on a map view.

Constraints:
- Don’t use Interface Builder, Story Boards, or UITableViewController.

Suggestions:
- Keep in mind the performance implications of large numbers of contacts in an address book.
- Take steps to keep the table view scrolling as fast as possible, even on a slow device.

Extra points for any cool features you add that aren’t explicitly mentioned here.
